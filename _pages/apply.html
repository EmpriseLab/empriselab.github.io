    <p align="left"><font size="4"><strong>We always welcome self-motivated and hard-working students <a href="https://empriselab.github.io/">who share our research interests and are passionate about our mission</a>. We are looking for a couple of Ph.D. students to join us in Fall 2021</strong>. If you are looking for a Ph.D. position, please read about our admission requirements <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/phd/admissions" target=_blank>here</a>. Unfortunately, we are not going to be able to reply to generic admissions related questions via email. If you are interested in working with Tapo, we would suggest applying to Cornell's CS Department and mention his name in your application packet.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="4">If you have any specific questions about our work, please email <a href="https://empriselab.github.io/people/">Tapo</a> with the code <strong>EmPRISE21</strong> in your email subject. Though he tries to respond to all the emails, the sheer volume of emails sometimes gets the better of him. So, this code is just so that he can focus on emails from people who have taken some time to read about our lab.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="4"></font>If you are a Master's or an Undergraduate student researcher at Cornell who is interested in working with us, please use the same code above in your email subject and send Tapo an email with your CV and transcripts. Typically, we do not fund master's or undergraduate student researchers when they just start out with the lab. We do offer research credits. Typically, you would end up working with a Ph.D. student mentor, if available.</p>
