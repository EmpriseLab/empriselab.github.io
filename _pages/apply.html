    <p align="left"><font size="4">We are looking for a couple of Ph.D. students to join us in Fall 2021. If you are looking for a Ph.D. position, please read about our admission requirements <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/phd/admissions" target=_blank>here</a>. Unfortunately, I am not going to be able to reply to generic admissions related questions via email. If you are interested in working with me, I would suggest applying to Cornell's CS Department and mention my name in your application packet.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="4">If you have any specific questions about our work, please email <a href="https://empriselab.github.io/people/">Tapo</a> with the code <strong>EmPRISE21</strong> in your email subject. Though I try to respond to all the emails, the sheer volume of emails sometimes gets the better of me. So, this is just so that I can focus on emails from people who have taken some time to read about our lab.</font></p>
