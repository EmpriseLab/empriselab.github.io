    <p align="left"><font size="4">Our mission is to enable robots to improve the quality of life of people with mobility limitations by assisting them with activities of daily living (ADLs). In our lab, we seek solutions to the fundamental research question on <i>how to leverage robot-world physical interactions in unstructured human environments to perform relevant ADLs</i>.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="4">Our lab is a part of the <a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/">Computer Science Department at Cornell University</a>. We are a full-stack robotics lab. Our projects delve deep into human-robot interaction, haptic perception, and robot manipulation. We are not only passionate about developing algorithms that solve fundamental problems in these domains but also strongly believe in developing real robotic systems, deploying them in the real world, and evaluating them with real users.</font></p>
