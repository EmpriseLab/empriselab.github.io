  bio: Tapomayukh "Tapo" Bhattacharjee will be joining the Department of Computer Science at Cornell University as a tenure-track Assistant Professor in Summer 2021. Tapo wants to enable robots to assist people with mobility limitations with tasks for daily living and he believes that allowing efficient and safe physical interactions between robots and their immediate environments is the key. His work spans the fields of human-robot interaction, haptic perception, and robot manipulation. Tapo, with his background in both ME and CS, is a full stack roboticist. He is not only passionate about developing algorithms that solve fundamental problems in these domains but also strongly believes in developing real robotic systems, deploying them in the real world, and evaluating them with real users.
